How to compile our programme in command line:
1) change directory using the 'cd' command followed by the 
path of where the programme src code is stored e.g "cd example\filename\src". 
2) then type in 'javac *.java' which will compile all of the java files in the src folder. 
3) then type in 'java Main' which will run the programme.

The programme was developed using JavaFX version 9.0.1.
Will work perfectly fine on Java version 9 and will run on Java version 8
but will show warnings due to the FXML files.
